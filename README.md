# PowerCrate

PowerCrate is a lightweight PowerShell toolbox for developers and power users.

It provides practical, no-nonsense commands to speed up everyday development and system tasks directly from the terminal.

Designed to grow over time, PowerCrate focuses on small, composable utilities that “just work” for common development and system workflows.

## Features

- `sln` Open the first (or interactively selected) Visual Studio solution (.sln) found under the current directory.

- `open` Open a file or directory using the operating system’s default file explorer (open ., open .., etc.).
